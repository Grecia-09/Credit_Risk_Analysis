# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to use Python to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk. In order to complete this task, I used imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling:

- Oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms.
- Undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm.
- Use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm.
- Compare two machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier.

After all, I evaluated the performance of these models and made a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
